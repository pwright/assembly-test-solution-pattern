*Washing a Cat*
****

Follow these steps to wash a cat:

. Put both lids of the toilet up.
. Add 1/8 cup of pet shampoo to the bowl.
. Pick up the cat, soothing him or her while carrying them to the bathroom.
. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid.
. Stand on the lid as necessary.
. At this point, the cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Ignore any noises of discomfort, the cat is actually enjoying this.
. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a `power wash` and `rinse`.
. Have someone open the front door of your home. Ensure nobody is between the bathroom and the frontt door.
. Stand back as far as possible and quickly lift the lid.
. The cat will rocket out of the bathroom, streak through the house, and run outside where they will dry themselves off.
. Both the toilet and cat will be sparkling clean.

Thank you for following these steps for my enjoyment.

Yours sincerely, 
The Dog.

Look at the cat and toilet to verify that both are clean.
