*Washing a Cat*
****

Follow these steps to wash a cat:

. Put both lids of the toilet up.
. Add 1/8 cup of pet shampoo to the bowl.
. Pick up the cat, soothing him or her while carrying them to the bathroom.
. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid.
. Stand on the lid as necessary.
. At this point, the cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Ignore any noises of discomfort, the cat is actually enjoying this.
. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a `power wash` and `rinse`.
. Have someone open the front door of your home. Ensure nobody is between the bathroom and the frontt door.
. Stand back as far as possible and quickly lift the lid.
. The cat will rocket out of the bathroom, streak through the house, and run outside where they will dry themselves off.
. Both the toilet and cat will be sparkling clean.
