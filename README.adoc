= Test to see if we can use AsciiDoc Assemblies

Uses an assembly for a solution pattern, breaking up the text into other adoc files for easier re-use and management.

This technique allows you author modules for Solution Patterns, then assemble the `walkthrough.adoc` files for Solution Explorer.

.Prerequisites

* https://asciidoctor-docs.netlify.app/[Asciidoctor Ruby] installed locally

.Procedure

. Author your Solution Pattern using the following file naming convention:
+
* `walkthroughs/assembly-<walkthrough-name>.adoc` - contains the first level heading and includes.
* `walkthroughs/<file-name>.adoc` - contains the content for each module

. Run the following command in the root of your repo to render the appropriate `walkthrough.adoc` files:
+
----
make render
----
+
This command coaleses the `assembly-<walkthrough-name>.adoc` file with the includes and overwrites the `<walkthrough-name>/walkthrough.adoc` file.
